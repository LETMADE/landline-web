## Getting Started

Developing on landline-web is fairly straightforward with the default development server:

```
touch .env
echo LANDLINE_API_URL=https://landline-dev.herokuapp.com >> .env
```

Then, after running `npm install` (but you've probably already done that, right?), just run `npm run dev` and you should be good to go.

Be sure to compile your changes with `npm run build` (or simply `webpack` if you have [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) installed globally) before committing and submitting a pull request.

## Hosted, flexible chat

### How Assembly Works

Assembly products are like open-source and made with contributions from the community. Assembly handles the boring stuff like hosting, support, financing, legal, etc. Once the product launches we collect the revenue and split the profits amongst the contributors.
